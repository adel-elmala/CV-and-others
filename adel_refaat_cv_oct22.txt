GRADUATION PROJECT        




Neural Model Optimization Tool         2021
* An automated optimization tool to help save time and resources in calibrating neural computational models to experimental measurements.
* Designed and implemented the back-end layer using Python and NEURON API, reading in the neuron model, extracting information about the model, simulating experimentation and computing characteristic features to pass to the next module in the tool pipeline.
* Grade : Distinctive 
* GitHub Repo: https://github.com/ForthePareto/SpikOpt


PERSONAL PROJECTS        




Ray Tracer          2022
* Built a ray tracer from first principles using no external libraries other than the one that will take the final pixel data and save it on disk in a PNG format.
* Used C++ and stbImage library for png encoding.
* GitHub Repo: https://github.com/adel-elmala/rayTracer
Rasterizer                2022
* Built a simple rasterizer from the ground up.
* Used C++ and SDL2 library to handle windowing and events.
* GitHub Repo: https://github.com/adel-elmala/rasterizer 
Small image processing Library        2021
* Optimized mini image processing library that handles gaussian blurring , alpha blending, thresholding.
*  implemented from scratch using C, Pthreads, And Intel‐intrinsics (SIMD) ,and  stbImage library.
